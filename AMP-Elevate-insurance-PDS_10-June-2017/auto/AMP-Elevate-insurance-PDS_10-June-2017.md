# Introducing AMP Elevate  

Live life knowing that we will be there for you.  

# We’ll be there for you when you need us  

Like most people, you probably don't think anything bad will ever happen to you.  

If something unexpected does happen, you want to protect what’s important. You don’t want to worry about how to pay the bills and look after your loved ones.  

With AMP Elevate insurance, we can help you to have that covered. What's more, if you need to make a claim, we’ll be there for you every step of the way.  

That’s why we’re Australia’s favourite for personal insurance 1 . In 2016 we paid 11,145 customers and a total of \$1.058 billion in insurance claims across our entire insurance range. That’s about \$2.9 million paid every day.  

# Our claims philosophy  

At AMP we see our role as more than just paying a claim. We create tailored solutions to help you and your family live the best life you can should something happen. While this may involve paying a financial benefit, depending on the nature of the claim it may also involve rehabilitation, working with you on a return to work program, or offering domestic assistance.

# What you need to know when applying for cover  

AMP Elevate insurance is an insurance product designed to provide financial benefits for you and your family when something unexpected happens.  

# Plan structure  

AMP Elevate offers a wide range of plans and options to structure your insurance which provides flexibility, so you can choose what cover you want and how to structure it – and only pay for what you choose.  

If you decide to hold some cover in super but want additional protection that is not available through super due to superannuationlaw,AMPElevateoffersFlexiLink,PremierLinkandStandardLinkoptionswhichcanbeaddedtoinsurance plans owned through super. You’ll find out more about these benefits starting on page 38.  

The various types of insurance covers can pay a lump sum amount or a monthly benefit. Please refer to the table below for the available structures for each insurance product.  

![](images/672f47de8c00ad23d35d6fca20f6b4394c3a7db86099447ec7684852eed73f86.jpg)  

# How do you want to structure your insurance?  

If you select more than one type of cover for the same insured person , you can choose to make the covers either standalone plans or link them under the same plan . Standalone plans generally have a higher premium than linked cover.  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">The structure can impact your insurance cover in the event of a claim</td></tr><tr><td>Standaloneplan</td><td>If we pay a benefit under a standalone plan (for example, a TPD Insurance Plan), it does not reduce the sum insured of any other cover (for example, a Life Insurance Plan) for the insured person. For example, you took $2 million in a Life Insurance Plan and $75o,ooo in a TPD Insurance Plan. If you made a TPD claim and a full benefit is paid, the $2 million on your Life Insurance Plan won't be reduced. You can purchase Lifeinsurance,TPD insurance,Traumainsurance,Incomeinsurance and Business expenses insurance asstandaloneplans that operateindependently of each other.</td></tr><tr><td>Linkedcovers</td><td>If we pay a benefit under a linked option (for example,a TPD option),the sum insured ofeach remaining linked cover(forexample,a LifeInsurancePlan)forthatinsured personisreduced bythe amount wepay,unlesswe stateotherwiseinthisPDs. in the table above. Income insurance plans and the Business Expenses Insurance Plan may not be linked with anylumpsumcovers. For example, you took $2 million in a Life Insurance Plan and $750,0o0 on a linked TPD option. If you made a TPD claim and the full benefit of $750,0o0 is paid, your Life Insurance Plan will be reduced to$1.25 million. Youcanpurchase TPDinsurance and Traumainsurance asoptions undera lifeInsurance plan.You can also purchase TPD insurance as an option under a trauma insurance plan.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# Purchasing plans outside and through super  

AMP Elevate provides ways to structure your plan by acquiring and paying for it outside or through super. We offer both super and SMSF plans to suit your needs.  

Flexible linking options – You can link TPD, Trauma and Income insurance cover outside super, with cover acquired through super. This can help manage your cashflow while enjoying the benefits of coverage options only available outside super. For more details about FlexiLink, PremierLink or StandardLink, see pages 18 to 22.  

# Insurance purchased outside super  

When purchasing insurance as a plan outside super, you can choose to link other types of insurance cover as options to your plan .

# Owning and paying your insurance through super  

AMP Elevate also allows you to pay for your insurance through super. There are some important differences to think about, compared to owning and paying for your insurance outside of super.  

Your financial adviser will help you to work out the way for you to structure your insurance so it is appropriate for your needs and circumstances.  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">Owning and paying through super</td><td>Owning and paying from funds outside super</td></tr><tr><td>In general</td><td>Can be a tax-effective way to pay premiums (if your taxable income is above the tax-free threshold, and below the high-income earners threshold). eg $100 premium will cost $100 from pre-tax income paid by your employer. The benefit is paid to the Trustee who then releases the benefit if a condition of release is met. Paying for your insurance through super could reduce your retirement savings. Premiums count towards your contribution caps. Premiums can be paid through various AMP platforms such as MyNorth, Summit, Generations and iAccess.</td><td>-You will be paying for premiums from after-tax income.</td></tr><tr><td>Life insurance</td><td>The Life benefit (page 50) is paid to the Trustee.

# What you need to tell us  

When you apply for insurance, and up until we accept your application, you have a duty to tell us anything you know, or could be reasonably be expected to know, that may affect our decision to insure you and the terms of your insurance. This means answering all the questions in the application honestly and ensuring you include all the information we ask for. You also have the same duty if you want to change, extend or reinstate your insurance in the future.  

A full description of your duty of disclosure is explained below.  

# Your duty of disclosure  

Read this if you are applying for insurance as the policy owner, or if you will be an insured person under a policy owned by someone else.  

# What you need to tell us  

When you apply for insurance, and up until the insurer accepts your application, you have a duty to tell us anything that you know, or could reasonably be expected to know, may affect the insurer’s decision to insure you and the terms of your insurance.  

This includes answering all the questions in the application honestly, making sure you include all the information we ask for.  

Youhavethesamedutyifanythingchanges,oryouremembermoreinformation,whilewe’reprocessingyourapplication.  

If you want to change your insurance cover at any time, extend it or reinstate it, you’ll also have the same duty at that time to tell us anything that may affect the insurer's decision to insure you and the terms of your insurance.  

Where a policy owned by one person covers the life of another person, it’s important that the other person also gives us all the information that is required under the duty. If he or she doesn't, then it can be treated as a failure by the owner of the policy to tell us something that the owner must tell us. Therefore, you must give us all the required information - whether you're the owner of the policy or an insured person under it.  

# If you don’t tell us something  

If you don’t give all the required information, and the missing information would’ve affected the insurer's decision to insure you or the terms of your insurance, the insurer may:  

–treat the contract (or your cover) as if it never existed – the insurer can only do this within three years of your cover starting.  

–reduce the amount you've been insured for – to reflect the premium you’ve been paying. There is a link between the premium you pay and your level of cover. If you fail to tell us something, your premiums may have been too low. The insurer may reduce the amount you've been insured for, taking into account the premium you would've had to pay if you'd told us everything you should've. For Death cover the insurer can only reduce the amount you've been insured for within three years of your cover starting.  

–vary your cover – to take into account the information you didn’t tell us and put the insurer in the same position as it would’ve been if you’d told us. Variations could mean, for example, that waiting periods, exclusions or premiums may be different. The insurer can't make variations to Death cover.  

Your total insurance cover forms one insurance contract. If you don't give us all the required information, the insurer may treat your different types of cover as separate contracts when it takes action to address this.  

It’s fraudulent to deliberately leave out required information or give us incorrect information. In these situations the insurer may refuse to pay a claim and treat the contract (or your cover) as if it never existed.  

# What you don't need to tell us  

You don’t need to tell us anything:   
– that reduces the insurer’s risk, or   
– that's common knowledge, or   
– the insurer know or should know as an insurer, or – we’ve told you that you don’t need to tell us.  

# Cooling-off period  

If we accept your application, we’ll send you an insurance schedule . Once you’ve received your insurance schedule you’ll have 28 days check that your plan meets your needs and let us know if it doesn't. This is known as the cooling-off period. If it doesn’t meet your needs, or you change your mind for any reason, simply contact us to cancel your plan.  

As long as you haven’t made a claim under your plan during the cooling-off period, we’ll cancel your plan and refund any amounts you’ve paid us. For insurance inside super, the refund will be paid to the Trustee . They will then refund the money to you subject to super preservation requirements.  

If you want to cancel your plan during the cooling-off period, you’ll need to contact us by:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Phone</td><td>131 267</td></tr><tr><td>Fax</td><td>1800674684</td></tr><tr><td>Email</td><td>askamp@amp.com.au</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td>AMPCustomerService</td></tr><tr><td>POB0X14330</td></tr><tr><td>Sendusaletter</td><td>MELBOURNEVIC8O01</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# Have your needs changed?  

If you’re not satisfied with your plan, please tell us. We may be able to change the plan. Changing to a new plan may require a reassessment of the insured person's health, occupation, pastimes and place of residence. It is usually better to modify your plan rather than to end it and start a new one.  

If you’re thinking of cancelling your existing insurance cover and replacing it with other cover, you need to know about certain risks that are involved.  

For example, you’ll probably need to provide current medical and financial information for the new application, and if your health has changed, this may affect the terms of the new cover. Also, if you cancel your current insurance while you’re applying or before the new cover starts, there may be some time that you won’t have insurance cover.  

# You can add more benefits to an existing plan  

If you wish to add an option to an existing plan , except for the PremierLink options, the StandardLink IP option and FlexiLink plans , you may do so. The option will be linked to your existing plan's terms and conditions. Should you wish to add a PremierLink option, StandardLink IP option, FlexiLink plan or an option from the latest PDS, then you may be required to cancel your existing plan and replace it with the corresponding plan in the latest PDS.  

You can also add a new plan , which uses the terms and conditions from the latest PDS.  

Please contact our Customer Contact Centre on 131 267 or your financial adviser if you have any questions.  

# Who can be an insured person  

The insured person is the person who is to be insured and must be within the ages set out in the table on pages 24 to 26 when applying for cover. The insured person is shown in the insurance schedule .  

The policy owner is the person who owns the plan and is sometimes also the insured person . If you purchase the plan through super, the policy owner will be the Trustee . This means that the insured person may not be the person to whom we pay benefits.  

# Who can own your insurance  

# Ownership  

AMP Elevate insurance can be structured in a way that best suits your needs. There are a range of ways to choose who owns the insurance plan and structure linked options , giving you flexibility and comprehensive cover that is tailored to your needs.

# Joint ownership  

If there's more than one owner of an insurance plan , it will be owned jointly. In the event one owner dies, the plan will continue to be owned in its entirety by the surviving policy owners . Relevant documentation is required to support the transfer.  

# Company or trust  

For income insurance plans and the Business Expenses Insurance Plan owned by a company or trust, the person who is to be covered under the plan must have a controlling interest in the company or must be a trustee of a trust that is satisfactory to us.  

# SMSF  

AMP Elevate insurance plans can be purchased by the trustee(s) of a SMSF or a small APRA Super Fund. The following plans are available through SMSF ownership or a small APRA Super Fund:  

– Life Insurance SMSF Plan – TPD Insurance SMSF Plan – Income Insurance SMSF Plan.  

TPD insurance is available through super as an option to the Life Insurance SMSF Plan.  

These plans are issued by AMP Life and are owned by the trustee(s) of an SMSF or small APRA Super Fund who are responsible for meeting the requirements under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (SIS).  

Where a claim is paid, it is paid to the trustee(s) of the SMSF or the small APRA Super Fund who can then release the benefit to you in accordance with superannuation law.  

We recommend that the trustee(s) seeks appropriate advice regarding the tax deductibility of premiums, the impact of SIS on purchasing insurance and conditions of release when insurance benefits are paid by the insurer to the trustee(s).  

# Superannuation  

AMP Elevate insurance offers the following plans which are held in our superannuation funds:  

– Life Insurance Superannuation Plan – TPD Insurance Superannuation Plan – Income Insurance Superannuation Plan  

These plans are owned by NM Super and the super fund may vary depending on how you pay your premiums:  

– If you are paying directly or via a partial rollover, your plan will be held within Super Directions with NM Super as the Trustee.   
– If you are paying through AMP’s MyNorth, Summit, Generations or iAccess, your plan will be held within Wealth Super with NM Super as the Trustee.  

TPD insurance is also available through super as an option to the Life Insurance Superannuation Plan.  

Where a claim is paid, it is paid to NM Super . The Trustee can then release the benefit to you in accordance with superannuation law.  

# FlexiLink, PremierLink and StandardLink  

Once you’ve seen the benefits of taking insurance cover and considered whether to hold your insurance outside or through super, you might find it’s hard to choose. With the linking options below, you can combine different types of insurance both inside and through super.  

To determine if your insurance should be held outside or through super, there are various factors to consider, such as eligibility to contribute, taxation, where your benefit will be paid if you make a claim, cost and the benefits included in the plan . Also note that the paying of insurance premiums from Wealth Super or by partial rollover will decrease the super balance available for your retirement.  

Your financial adviser can assist you to determine the ownership that is appropriate for your individual needs.  

# How FlexiLink works  

If you purchase Life insurance through super, FlexiLink allows you to link Trauma insurance and/or TPD insurance held outside super.

# FlexiLink example  

You have Life insurance cover with a sum insured of \$2 million and a FlexiLink Trauma plan with a sum insured of \$500,000. If you made a Trauma claim under the FlexiLink Trauma plan and were paid the full benefit, your Life insurance and Trauma insurance sums insured would each reduce by \$500,000.  

# How PremierLink TPD works  

The PremierLink TPD option provides flexibility in structuring your TPD insurance.  

The PremierLink TPD option allows you to link a TPD own occupation benefit, along with other benefits which are not available through super, under a separate plan if you purchase:  

– a TPD any occupation option on a Life Insurance Superannuation Plan or a Life Insurance SMSF Plan, or – a TPD Insurance Superannuation Plan or TPD Insurance SMSF Plan.

# What can you apply for?  

# How much can you insure?  

You’ll need to decide how much cover suits your needs.  

The amount that you’re insured for is known as the sum insured for a lump sum payment or the monthly benefit for Income insurance or Business expenses insurance. This amount is fixed and will only change if your cover is increased to keep up with inflation (see page 48 or 72), or you later apply to increase or decrease your cover.  

This section shows the maximum and minimum sum insured or monthly benefit amounts that you can apply for.   
Subject to underwriting, we may offer you cover on the terms you have applied for or on different terms.

# Cost of insurance  

# What are insurance premiums?  

Your insurance premiums are the cost you pay for your insurance cover and depend on many factors. You need to pay your insurance premiums by the due date from when your cover starts until it stops.  

There are fees, charges and discounts that may apply to your plan. Please see page 31 for further detail.  

When you apply for insurance cover, you will have a choice regarding how to structure your insurance premium. AMP Elevate offers stepped, level and blended premium structures, providing you with flexibility and control. Each premium structure works differently and will likely result in you paying a different amount overall.  

There are also different ways to pay your insurance premium and how often you’d like to pay it. You can find the full details on page 110.  

# How we work out your insurance premium  

We work out your insurance premium based on what cover you select, the sums insured you’ve chosen and other factors, including but not limited to:  

– age   
– gender   
– smoking status   
– medical history   
– occupation   
– general health   
– premium structure and payment frequency selected   
– stamp duty  

Depending on your circumstances, each of these factors may affect the amount you need to pay.  

For income insurance plans and the Business Expenses Insurance Plan, your premium is also affected by the waiting period and benefit period you choose.  

We may review premium rates from time to time, full details can be found on page 32.  

You can get a copy of our standard premium rate tables by contacting your financial adviser or our Customer Contact Centre on 131 267.  

Premium structures  

Depending on the plan you purchase, there are up to three premium structures available to you – stepped, level and blended.  

The figure below shows how the premium changes as the insured person's age increases under each of the premium structures. You should consider this section carefully before applying for a plan.  

![](images/a3076b13667ec648db39a51f92c77f3e1cd2df7578f38c2dc2fd991e9335bb47.jpg)  

# Stepped premiums  

Steppedpremiumschangeeveryyearontheplan renewal date according to the insured person's age .Generally, premiums increase as the insured person gets older. This is in addition to premium changes due to automatic inflation increases.  

From time to time we may perform a general review of our premium rates, and any changes that we make will apply to all owners of a similar type of plan. For more details, please refer to Variations on page 32. You can also choose to freeze your premiums at any time. If you do this your sum insured will reduce each year accordingly. Refer to Premium freeze on pages 55 and 91.  

# Level premiums  

Level premiums don’t increase each year as the insured person gets older, and as such they generally stay the same for each layer of cover 1 during the term of your plan. However, they are not guaranteed. For example, level premiums will increase if you selected to keep up with increases in inflation or you increase the sum insured .  

From time to time we may perform a general review of our premium rates, and any changes that we make will apply to all owners of a similar type of plan. For more details, please refer to Variations on page 32.  

When you apply for Life, Trauma and TPD insurance cover, you can select a premium switch age, which is the age at which your level premium will move to a stepped premium (see Stepped premiums section above). Your premium switch age may be less than your cover cease age, which determines when your plan expires. Your premiumswillswitchautomaticallyfromlevelpremiums to stepped at the switch age you have chosen. Your insurance schedule will show the age you’ve selected to switch the premium structure as well as the overall cover cease age.  

The level premium rate charged will be based on the insured person's age when each layer of cover starts. For our Life, Trauma and TPD insurance plans, level premiums will only change if:  

– the insured person is over age 70 (or the nominated switch age you have chosen). When this happens, we’ll change your level premiums to stepped premiums on the renewal date after the insured person turns70ortheirswitchage(whicheveroccurs first), or earlier if requested. This is known as the level premium cease age.   
– you ask us to change your sum insured (including by exercising an option) or make an alteration to the plan which impacts the premium,  

– you choose to have your sum insured increased to keep up with increases in inflation, or – we review the premium rates for all plans of this type. See Variations on page 32.  

For our income insurance plans and the Business ExpensesInsurancePlan,levelpremiumswillonlychange if:  

– you ask us to change your monthly benefit or make analterationtotheplanwhichimpactsthepremium   
– you choose to have your monthly benefit increased to keep up with increases in inflation   
– we review the premium rates for all plans of this type, see Variations on page 32, or   
– we review the insured person's occupation category.  

# Blended premiums  

# (Available on Life, TPD and Trauma insurance plans only)  

Under a blended premium structure, you’ll pay stepped premiums for the first 10 years followed by level premiums until the insured person turns 60, and then stepped premiums until the cover cease age.  

For each layer of cover 1 , we adjust your premiums each year for the first 10 years of your cover according to the insured person's age, just like stepped premiums. During this time, the premium will normally increase each year as the insured person gets older.  

Following the first 10 years and until age 60, your premiumswon’tchangeaccordingtothe insuredperson's age, like level premiums. After he or she turns 60, the premiums switch back to stepped premiums.  

During the time that level premiums apply, premiums will only change if:  

– you ask us to change your sum insured (including by exercising an option) or make an alteration to the plan which impacts the premium,   
– you choose to have your sum insured increased to keep up with increases in inflation,   
– we review the premium rates for all plans of this type.  

# Combining stepped and level premiums for different options  

If you purchase a life insurance plan , you have the flexibility to choose between stepped and level premium structures across your plan and the different options you’ve chosen.  

For example, you can purchase a Life Insurance Plan on level premiums with a linked TPD option on stepped premiums.  

These options include Trauma, Trauma Plus, Double Trauma, Double Trauma Plus, TPD, Double TPD, ADL TPD, FlexiLink Trauma, FlexiLink Trauma Plus and FlexiLink TPD.  

If your plan is on a blended premium, these options must also be on a blended premium structure.  

# Fees, charges and discounts  

# Minimum premium  

Aminimumyearlypremiumof\$250applies.Thisincludes the plan fee and other charges.  

The minimum premium applies to the sum of premiums for:  

– an individual's linked plans (please refer to We may waive the plan fee if you have additional plans section below for more information), and – plans linked by way of family relationship and/or business partner relationship.  

# Fees and charges  

All charges (other than the cost of providing the insurance) for the plan are described in this section. We won't apply any other charges without your consent.  

# Plan fee  

The plan fee pays for the establishment and administration of your plan.  

In certain circumstances only one plan fee will be applicable. The conditions for this are outlined in the We may waive the plan fee if you have additional plans section below.  

The plan fee as at 10 June 2017 for each particular payment frequency is outlined below.  

Plan fee payments   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Paymentfrequency</td><td>Plan fee per payment ($)</td></tr><tr><td>Fortnightly</td><td>2.82</td></tr><tr><td>Monthly</td><td>5.88</td></tr><tr><td>Quarterly</td><td>17.64</td></tr><tr><td>Half-yearly</td><td>35.28</td></tr><tr><td>Yearly</td><td>67.56</td></tr></table></body></html>  

On the renewal date following 1 January each year, the plan fee will rise by any increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI or Index). For the purpose of calculating increases in CPI, we use the last published Index for the 12 months ending 30 September each year. However, we may use the Index published for a more recent 12 month period and/or another index or rate which we believe more fairly and accurately reflects changes in the cost of living.  

The increase we make will normally be based on the Australian National All Groups Consumer Price Index weighted average of eight capital cities combined.  

# We may waive the plan fee if you have additional plans  

If you have other plan(s) from this PDS or from another insurance product series, these may be considered as linked plans. We may waive the plan fee on these linked plans. We may also waive the plan fee in instances where your spouse or other family member, or your business partner, has a plan with us.  

If you do not nominate a plan, we will determine which plan the plan fee waiver will apply to.  

The plan fee waiver provides you with only one plan fee and reduced minimum premiums for linked plans. The plan fee waiver is available for a maximum of 19 plans.  

The insurance schedule shows which plan is a primary plan and which plan(s) have had the plan fees waived.  

# Instalment loading  

An instalment loading applies if you pay more frequently than yearly; this is in addition to the plan fee payments described above. As at 10 June 2017, the instalment loading is 3.5% of the annual premium for half-yearly payments and 7% for all other premium payment frequencies.  

# Government stamp duty  

A government stamp duty is imposed on most of the plans and options outlined in this document, based on the state in which the insured person lives. The stamp duty rates and how they are charged vary from state to state and depend on the type of insurance cover that has been purchased.  

The stamp duty will be included in, or in addition to, the insurance premium. If the stamp duty is charged in addition to the insurance premium, it will be shown as a separate item on the insurance schedule .  

State governments may change the rate of stamp duty or method of calculation from time to time, and any change may affect the amount you pay.  

# Discounts

This discount is available where two or more clients are in a business relationship and submit new business to AMP.

These discounts are not guaranteed. To see whether you qualify for the large case discount please contact your financial adviser .  

# Multi plan discount

# Variations  

# We can change your premium

Those tables show, for each premium structure, factors and premium rates for each age, based on a person's gender, occupation and smoking status.

# About AMP Elevate Total and Permanent Disability insurance  

Protection in the event of permanent disability  

The AMP Elevate Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) insurance plans provide a lump sum benefit to help you cope financially if you are unlikely to work again, suffer a specific loss, require future care, are unlikely to perform domestic work or suffer significant cognitive impairment (see pages 119 to 120 for the definitions).  

# TPD insurance  

AMP Elevate has the following TPD insurance types:  

– TPD own occupation   
– TPD any occupation   
– Activities of Daily Living TPD (ADL TPD).  

# TPD insurance as a plan  

The TPD (own and any occupation) and ADL TPD insurance can be purchased independently of Life insurance through the TPD Insurance Plan and the ADL TPD Insurance Plan outside super.  

The TPD Insurance Superannuation Plan and TPD Insurance SMSF Plan allows you to purchase TPD (any occupation) independently of Life insurance.  

# TPD insurance as an option  

TPD insurance (own and any occupation) can be purchased as an option linked to Life insurance or Trauma insurance. ADL TPD insurance can only be purchased as an option on Life insurance.  

# FlexiLink TPD  

FlexiLink TPD (own and any occupation) can be linked to Life insurance. FlexiLink TPD works in a similar way to a TPD insurance option with regards to how they are priced and how they function.  

Certain parameters of the FlexiLink TPD Insurance Plan must match the life insurance plan to which it is linked. For example, where automatic inflation increases are accepted on one plan, this increase must be accepted on the linked plan(s).  

# PremierLink TPD option  

The PremierLink TPD option (own occupation) can be linked to a TPD any occupation option held on any of the life insurance plans , or linked to a TPD Insurance Superannuation Plan or TPD Insurance SMSF Plan. The PremierLink TPD option has the same structure as the linked TPD any occupation insurance. For example, they will have the same sum insured , which cannot exceed the sum insured of the life insurance plan or TPD insurance plan to which they are linked. The PremierLink TPD option has the same premium structure and the same renewal date as the TPD any occupation option. If an increase or reduction is made to the TPD any occupation insurance, the alteration will automatically be applied to the PremierLink TPD option.  

# TPD types  

The definition of TPD varies according to the type of plan you have. You may want to consider how specialised your occupation is and how important it is to you to return to the same role.  

TPD insurance can be purchased as one of the following types:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>TPD types</td><td>Whatyouneedtoconsider</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>TPDownoccupation</td><td>NS</td><td>Theinsuredpersonwillbeassessed againsttheirabilitytoreturntotheirown occupation,whichisanarrowersetofcriteria.</td></tr><tr><td>TPDanyoccupation</td><td>NS SMSF</td><td>Theinsuredpersonwillbeassessedagainsttheirabilitytoreturntoanyoccupation within their education, training or experience, which includes jobs other than whattheywere doingbeforebecomingdisabled.</td></tr><tr><td>Activitiesof DailyLivingTPD (ADLTPD)</td><td>NSSMSF</td><td>Theinsuredpersonwillbe assessed againsthowtheirdisabilityhasresulted in theinabilitytoperformkey activitiesofdailylivingorwhethersignificantcognitive impairment requires them tobe under continuous supervision.</td></tr></table></body></html>

![](images/3646b478e50dd9bd426537b4c8bf6ef4a30d46d9775d951463e77a125a45149a.jpg)  

# Automatic inflation  

To protect your benefit against the effects of inflation, up until age 65 your sum insured is automatically increased each year on the renewal date by the greater of 5% or the increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).  

Your premium will increase as a result of this increase in the suminsured .Youmaydeclinetheincreaseinthe sum insured for any particular year or for all years by writing to us.  

The increase to your sum insured only applies to a claim you make under the plan that happens after the date of the increase.  

If you hold the Life Insurance Superannuation Plan or Life Insurance SMSF Plan and the premiums are paid by your employer you must get agreement from your employer to allow Automatic inflation to be applied to your plan.  

We won’t increase the sum insured :  

– after the insured person's 65th birthday, or   
– where a loading exceeding 100% is applied to your premium, or   
– on a Business solutions option (page 55), or   
– on a Children’s trauma option (page 60), or   
– while Premium freeze (page 55) or the Premium waiver option (page 57) is exercised.  

For all TPD options, trauma options and FlexiLink plans We won’t increase the sum insured for a TPD option ,trauma option or FlexiLink plan by any amount which would cause the sum insured to exceed that of the plan or option to which these options are linked.  

Any revised terms applicable to your plan will also apply to increases exercised under this benefit.  

# The CPI information we use  

The increase we make to the sum insured will normally bebasedontheAustralianNationalAllGroupsConsumerPrice Index weighted average of eight capital cities combined. We use the last published Index for the 12 months ending 30 September each year. Any increase will be applied on the next renewal date on or after 1 January of the following year. However, we may use the Index published for a more recent 12 month period and/or another index or rate which we believe more fairly and accurately reflects changes in the cost of living.  

This benefit is not available where the plan is established by the exercise under another plan of a:  

– 12-month Life buy back (page 53), or – Life buy back - TPD option (page 58), or – Life buy back - Trauma option (page 59), or – Trauma reinstatement option (page 59).  

# Future insurability benefit  

This benefit allows you to increase your sum insured once in any 12 month period without the need to provide further health evidence when one or more specified personal or business events occurs.  

You must apply for the increase within 12 months after the date the specified event occurs.  

You will be required to provide evidence that is acceptable to us and supports the increase to your sum insured .  

# How much additional cover you can purchase  

The maximum amount of increase for any one event will be limited to the lowest of:  

– 25% of the sum insured   
– \$200,000   
– where the increase relates to a mortgage, the amount of the mortgage or the increase to the mortgage, or

# When the Future insurability benefit does not apply  

The Future insurability benefit cannot be exercised if at the time of your application:  

– the insured person has previously been accepted by us with a medical loading greater than 50% under a plan held with us, or – the insured person is currently entitled to make, or has made, a claim for a terminal illness, TPD or Trauma benefit under a plan held with us.  

# Restrictions on the increased sum insured  

For the first six months from the date of the increase, we will only pay the amount of the increase in the sum insured in the event of:  

– accidental death,   
– accidental total and permanent disability (caused by violent, accidental, external and visible means), or   
– the insured person suffering an accidental trauma condition .  

This benefit will expire on the insured person's 55th birthday. The specified event for which you are applying for an increase must occur prior to the insured person's 55th birthday.  

# How to exercise the Future insurability benefit  

You can exercise the Future Insurability benefit by completing the "Future Insurability Benefit for Life, Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) and Trauma insurance" form with the evidence required for the specified event as listed in this section.  

# Life benefit  

#  

If the insured person dies we’ll pay the Life insurance sum insured . This amount is paid once only as a lump sum. The Life insurance sum insured is specified on the insurance schedule .  

# Terminal illness benefit  

If the insured person becomes terminally ill, you may ask us to pay the Life insurance sum insured . This amount is paid once only as a lump sum and is an advance payment of the Life benefit (see above). The Life insurance sum insured is specified on the insurance schedule .  

We’ll only pay if the insured person becomes terminally ill:  

– after this plan commences,   
– before this plan ends, and   
– before the insured person reaches the benefit expiry age for the plan.  

The Terminal illness benefit is not payable under a plan which has lapsed, been cancelled or is otherwise not in force prior to the date the insured person becomes terminally ill.  

For the Life Insurance Plan, terminally ill means: – a medicalpractitioner hascertifiedthatthe insured person suffers from an illness, or has incurred an injury, that is likely to result in the insured person's death within 12 months, and – we agree with that prognosis.  

For the Life Insurance Superannuation Plan or Life   
Insurance SMSF Plan, – terminally ill means: – two medical practitioners have certified, jointly or separately, that the insured person suffers from an illness, or has incurred an injury, that is likely to result in the insured person's death within 12 months of the date of certification – at least one of the medical practitioners is a specialist practising in an area related to the illness or injury, and – for each of the certificates, the certification period has not ended. – If a terminal illness claim is admitted, we'll pay the sum insured to the Trustee . If the Trustee is satisfied that the insured person's situation meets the condition of release, they will make the proceeds available to you.  

We may ask you to provide additional evidence that we require in order to agree with the prognosis. This may include providing information through medical practitioners we choose.  

The amount of the Terminal illness benefit we’ll pay is theamountoftheLifeinsurance suminsured thatapplies when the insured person becomes terminally ill. On payment of the Terminal illness benefit, the Life benefit will cease.  

The certifying medical practitioner cannot be the insured person's familymember,businesspartner,youremployee or employer.  

A Terminal illness benefit is only payable if the insured person holds a life insurance plan .  

# Accommodation benefit  

We'll pay for the accommodation costs of the insured person's immediate family member , if we pay 100% of the sum insured under the Terminal illness benefit (page 50), TPD benefit (page 51) or Trauma benefit (page 53), and a medical practitioner certifies that the insured person must remain confined to bed due to the reason for which we paid the Terminal illness/TPD/Trauma benefit, and:  

– the insured person is more than 100km from his or her home, or needs to travel to a place that is more than 100km from his or her home for medical treatment , and an immediate family member is required to stay with the insured person , or – an immediatefamilymember isrequiredtostaywith the insuredperson andmusttravelmorethan100km from his or her home to do so.  

We’ll pay up to a maximum of\$150 per day for each day that the insured person remains confined to bed and his or her immediate family member remains away from their home, for a maximum of 14 days.  

Thisbenefitmustbeclaimedwithinsixweeksfromwhen we pay the Terminal illness/TPD/Trauma benefit. You mustsendusevidencethatthe insuredperson isconfined to bed and payment of the accommodation costs which is acceptable to us.  

The Accommodation benefit will only be paid once across all plans or options you have with us under which the insured person is covered.  

The amount we pay under the Accommodation benefit won’t reduce any other benefit that’s payable under your plan .  

If a TPD any occupation plan/option and PremierLink TPD option are both purchased, this benefit will be paid under the PremierLink TPD option held outside of superannuation.  

This benefit is not payable under the Partial TPD benefit (page52)oranyofthePartialpayment traumaconditions (page 54).  

# Advancement of funeral expenses benefit  

This benefit provides an advance payment for funeral expenses on receipt of the death certificate or other proof of death of the insured person which is acceptable to us.  

The amount payable is the Life insurance sum insured, up to a maximum of \$20,000.  

If we pay this benefit, then the Life insurance sum insured will be reduced by the amount we pay.  

This benefit is not payable if the insured person's death is due to suicide within the first 13 months from the commencement or reinstatement of cover.  

Any payment of this benefit is not an admission of liability to pay the full Life benefit (page 50). Please note that nominating a beneficiary may enhance the timeliness with which this benefit can be paid.  

# Financial plan benefit  

If we pay 100% of the sum insured , we'll reimburse the recipient of the benefit, up to \$2,000 for the cost of financial planning advice.  

The advice must be received within six months of us paying the sum insured . The advice must be from a representative of an Australian Financial Services Licensee.  

We’ll only pay the Financial plan benefit once regardless of the number of plans or options held with us under whichthe insured person iscovered.  

If a TPD any occupation and PremierLink TPD option are both purchased, this benefit will be paid under the PremierLink TPD option held outside of superannuation.  

The payment of the Financial plan benefit will not reduce any other benefit payable under the plan.  

# TPD benefit  

If the insured person is totally and permanently disabled (TPD), we'll pay the TPD insurance sum insured as specified on the insurance schedule . The definition of TPD varies according to the type of plan you have and whether your TPD plan is TPD own occupation ,TPD any occupation or TPD ADL .  

If we pay a TPD benefit under a TPD option , the sum insured of the linked plan and any linked trauma insurance will be reduced by the amount we pay.  

The definitions below need to be considered with the TPD definitions in the Glossary of Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) insurance definitions (pages 119 to 120).

# Survival period  

If a TPD option is linked to a life insurance plan or a FlexiLink TPD plan, there is no survival period requirement. We'll pay the TPD benefit as soon as the insured person meets the definition of total and permanent disability.  

# If you purchase a:  

– TPD Insurance Plan (Any or Own)   
– TPD Insurance Superannuation Plan (Any), or   
– TPD Insurance SMSF Plan (Any), or   
–TPD option linked to a trauma insurance plan , or –Double TPD option ,  
and the insured person is classified as totally and   
permanently disabled, an eight day survival period applies. We'll only pay the TPD benefit upon the insured person's survival of eight days from the date the insured person becomes eligible for a TPD benefit.  

# Day one TPD benefit  

If the insured person has been diagnosed by a medical practitioner as suffering from one of the listed medical conditions below, we'll waive the requirement to be unable to work for three months when assessing a claim made under:  

– definition A - unlikely to work   
– definitionD-unlikelytoperformdomesticwork(only available for TPD insurance plans and TPD options held outside super)  

outlined in the TPD benefit (page 51).

# Partial TPD benefit  

We’ll pay part of the TPD benefit (page 51) if the insured person suffers the total and permanent loss of the use of:  

– one hand, or   
– one foot, or   
– the entire sight in one eye.  

We’ll only pay once under this benefit.  

The Partial TPD benefit is not available if TPD is purchased as an option on the Life Insurance Superannuation Plan or Life Insurance SMSF Plan.  

# How much we will pay  

We’ll pay 25% of the TPD insurance sum insured, up to a maximum of \$500,000.  

Any payment made under the Partial TPD benefit won't be considered a payment of the TPD benefit (page 51).  

If you have purchased both TPD Insurance and Trauma Insurance Plus on the same plan (or they are linked through a FlexiLink plan or PremierLink TPD option), and if you’re eligible to claim under both benefits, we’ll only pay the higher of:  

–the Partial TPD benefit under this benefit, or – the benefit for Loss of a limb under the Trauma Insurance Plus Plan.  

# What happens to the balance of the TPD benefit?  

In the event that a payment is made under the Partial TPD benefit, your plan will not end, however the TPD insurance sum insured will be reduced by the amount we pay. If you have purchased a TPD option (excluding the Double TPD option ) or FlexiLink TPD plan , the sum insured of the remaining linked cover ( plans and options )for that insured person is reduced by the amount we pay.  

# Death benefit  

We'll pay the Death benefit if the insured person dies. This benefit must be claimed within 12 months of the insured person’s death.  

We'll pay the TPD insurance sum insured , up to a maximum of \$10,000.  

This benefit is not payable if:  

– you make a fraudulent claim, or   
– the insured person commits suicide within 13 months of the commencement date or the date the plan was restored.  

The Death benefit is only available if the insured person does not have Life insurance cover under this plan or any other plan where AMP Life is the insurer.  

# ₁₂ -month Life buy back  

If we pay 100% of the TPD benefit under the TPD option, and this leads to a decrease in the Life benefit on the life insurance plan , you may choose to buy another plan providing life insurance on the life of that insured person (the new plan). The new plan can be purchased without the need to provide us with any health or other evidence.  

# How to exercise this option  

You can buy the new plan by submitting to us the required form, plus the appropriate premium, one year after the TPD benefit was paid. If we do not hear from you within 30 days of that date, you will lose the right to buy the new plan and this option will cease.  

# How much cover can I apply for?  

The maximum amount of life insurance you can apply for under the new plan is the lower of:  

– the sum insured of the TPD option , and – the amount of the decrease in the Life benefit that occurred under the life insurance plan due to any TPD benefit payment.  

The new plan must be an equivalent plan that AMP is issuing at the time the feature is available to exercise. If we have a number of life insurance plans on-sale, we’ll decide which plan or plans are available for purchase under this option.  

The premium payable for the new plan will be based on the premium rates and plan terms and conditions applicable at the time the new plan is applied for. The new plan will be subject to any revised terms such as exclusions and loadings that applied to the original plan.  

Any exclusion periods, qualifying periods or duty of disclosure requirements on the new plan will be regarded as having applied from the time of taking out the original plan.  

Increases to the sum insured under Automatic inflation (page 48) and the Future insurability benefit (page 48) will not be available on the new life insurance plan .This option can only be exercised once.  

If you have exercised Life buy back - TPD option (page 58) or Double TPD option (page 57), then you cannot exercise this option.  

This benefit cannot be exercised if a benefit for Terminal Illness has been paid previously for that insured person .  

This option will expire if not excercised prior to insured person's 65 th birthday.  

# Trauma benefit  

We’ll pay the Trauma insurance sum insured if the insured person suffers a trauma condition . The trauma conditions covered are listed on pages 44 to 46 and defined in the Glossary of medical conditions starting on page 120.  

If we pay a Trauma benefit under a trauma option , the sum insured of the linked plan and any linked TPD insurance will be reduced by the amount we pay.  

# Specific rules  

– The trauma condition (except loss of capacity for independent living) must have occurred before the first renewal date after the insured person turns 70. After the insured person turns 70, they may be covered for loss of capacity for independent living which occurred before they turn 99. – Where the trauma condition definition refers to a diagnosis, the diagnosis must be based on clinical, radiological, histological and laboratory evidence which is acceptable to us. A suitable medical practitioner must make the diagnosis. – Where the trauma condition definition refers to a 25% impairment of whole body function, we’ll rely on the latest published edition of American Medical Association (AMA) Guides to the Evaluation of PermanentImpairment.Assessmentmustbecarried out by a medical practitioner accredited in the evaluation of permanent impairment.  

# How much we'll pay  

In the case of all trauma conditions , except those listed in the Partial payment trauma conditions section below, we’ll pay 100% of the Trauma insurance sum insured as it appears in the insurance schedule .

# When trauma insurance starts  

For most of the trauma conditions covered, Trauma insurance starts upon commencement of your plan. However, some of the trauma conditions are subject to a qualifying period. These are identified in the tables on pages 44 to 46.  

For trauma conditions that are not subject to a qualifying period  

Trauma insurance starts on:   
– The commencement date of the trauma insurance plan or trauma option specified on the insurance schedule   
– Thedatethe traumainsuranceplan or trauma option is restored   
– The effective date of any increase in your Trauma insurance sum insured (except for any increases under the Business solutions option on page 55 and Automatic inflation on page 48).   
For trauma conditions that are subject to a 90 day   
qualifying period   
Trauma insurance starts 90 days after:   
– The commencement date of the trauma insurance plan or trauma option specified on the insurance schedule   
– Thedatethe traumainsuranceplan or traumaoption is restored   
– The effective date of any increase in your Trauma insurance sum insured (except for any increases under the Business solutions option on page 55 and Automatic inflation on page 48).   
Further to the above, we won't pay a Trauma benefit if   
the insuredperson developsevidenceof,orseesa medical   
practitioner for, that condition within 90 days of any of   
the following:   
– The commencement date of the trauma insurance plan or trauma option specified on the insurance schedule   
– The date the trauma insurance plan or trauma option is restored   
– The effective date of any increase in your Trauma insurance sum insured (except for any increases under the Business solutions option on page 55 and Automatic inflation on page 48).  

The trauma conditions table on pages 44 to 46 lists all of the trauma conditions and specifies which conditions are subject to a qualifying period.  

# If you’re paid a Trauma benefit  

If we pay 100% of the Trauma insurance sum insured for a trauma insurance plan , the trauma insurance plan and any linked options will cease and you won’t be entitled to any more benefits. If we pay 100% of the Trauma insurance sum insured for a trauma option or FlexiLink trauma plan (other than where a Double trauma option has been purchased):  

– the trauma option or FlexiLink trauma plan and any options l inked to them will cease, and – the benefit of any plan that the trauma option or FlexiLink trauma plan is linked (including linked TPD option or FlexiLink TPD plan ) will be reduced by the benefit we pay for trauma.  

If the sum insured of that plan is reduced to nil by this, that plan and all linked options will cease and you won't be entitled to any more benefits, otherwise that plan will continue with the reduced sum insured .  

If a payment is made under a partial payment trauma condition , including cancer early payment, the plan won’t end, however the Trauma insurance sum insured and any linked TPD insurance will be reduced by the amount we pay.  

Where the insurance schedule shows a Double trauma option (page 59) and 100% of the Trauma insurance sum insured is paid, any life insurance plan to which this option is linked won't reduce. However, any linked TPD option or FlexiLinkTPDplan willbereducedbythebenefit we pay for Trauma insurance.  

Where the insurance schedule shows a Children’s trauma option (page 60) and a benefit is paid, the Children's trauma option will cease but it won’t reduce the sum insured of the plan it is linked to or the sum insured for any other Children’s trauma option.  

# Survival period  

If you purchase a trauma option linked to a life insurance plan , or a FlexiLink trauma insurance plan, and you suffer a trauma condition (outlined in the trauma conditions table on pages 44 to 46) and the insured person meets the definition, there is no survival period requirement.  

If you purchase a:  

–trauma insurance plan , or –Double trauma option , and the insured person suffers a trauma condition (outlined in the trauma conditions table on pages 44 to 46) and meets the definition, a 14 day survival period applies from the date the insured person becomes eligible for a Trauma benefit.  

# Premium freeze  

# This option is only available for stepped premiums.  

Exercising this option allows you to maintain your current premium at the time this option is exercised. Your sum insured will reduce each year that this option is applied.  

If you choose to cancel Premium freeze, your sum insured current at that time will not reduce anymore and Automatic inflation (page 48) will recommence without further health evidence. Premiums will then increase each year according to your age.  

You can request to exercise Premium freeze or cancel it at any time, which will take effect from the next renewal date of the plan .  

If you wish to request a Premium freeze, you must let us knowinwriting.Anyspecialconditionssuchasexclusions and loadings will still apply.  

Automatic inflation (page 48) will not apply while Premium freeze is exercised. Premium freeze is not available on a FlexiLink plan , PremierLink TPD option or the plans/options to which they are linked.  

# Upgrade of benefits  

If we make future improvements to your plan , and such improvements would not result in an increase in premium rates, we’ll pass these changes on to you without you having to provide us with any medical evidence or evidence regarding the insured person's occupation, pastimes or place of residence.  

Upgrades provide improvements to your plan including additional benefits and improved definitions. You will still retain your existing terms, conditions and premium rates for your plan .  

Any improvements and/or changes to your plan definitions will always be reviewed at claim time to ensurethe insuredperson isassessedusingthedefinition that benefits them the most. This means that should a definition or benefit from the original plan be more beneficial, you’ll still be eligible to claim under your original plan definitions.  

If the insured person is suffering a pre-existing condition at the time the improvement is provided, the improvement will not apply when assessing any claim affected by that pre-existing condition .  

# ₂₄ -hour worldwide cover  

We’ll cover the insured person 24 hours a day anywhere in the world, subject to the terms and conditions of the plan. If he or she is sick or injured outside Australia or New Zealand, we may require additional medical documentation and/or medical examinations by a medical practitioner chosen by us to support the claim.

We won't pay a benefit if the insured person has a medical condition, injury or sickness that has been excluded based on their health, pastimes or occupation. These additional exclusions will be specified on the insurance schedule .  

# Delay in claim reporting  

The sooner we’re notified of the insured person's death, illness or injury the more effectively we’ll be able to assess the claim. If we’re not notified of the insured person's death, illness or injury as soon as reasonably possible, we may reduce the amount of any benefit paid, to the extent that we’ve been prejudiced by this delay.

# Included benefits  

The benefits explained in this section are included in your plan at no additional cost. A summary is set out in Benefits and features at a glance on page 66 for income insurance plans and on page 70 for the Business Expenses Insurance Plan.  

![](images/6d85f89fd079dceede6cb31edbc80d1a8d0b83a87f7b4d17a0598afe8d2f6815.jpg)  

To protect your benefit against the effects of inflation, up until age 65, your monthly benefit is automatically increased each year on the renewal date by the greater of 3% or the Consumer Price Index (CPI).  

Your premium will increase as a result of this increase in the monthly benefit . You may decline the monthly benefit increase for any particular year or for all years by writing to us.  

The increase to the monthly benefit on the schedule only applies to a claim you make under the plan that happens after the date of the increase. If insured person suffers the injury or sickness before the increase, or are on a claim at the time of the increase, the monthly benefit on the insurance schedule at the start of the claim will apply.  

The increased monthly benefit on the insurance schedule will only apply for any later and separate claims. The increased monthly benefit will be reflected in your premiums.  

These increases only occuruntil the insured person's 65th birthday.  

Automaticinflationwillnotbepermittedwherealoading exceeding 100% is applied to your premium. Any revised terms applicable to your policy will also apply to increases exercised under this benefit.  

# ForIncomeInsuranceSuperannuationPlansandIncome Insurance SMSF plans  

If your premiums are paid by your employer, you must get agreement from your employer to allow indexation to be applied to your plan.  

# The CPI information we use  

The increase we make to the monthly benefit on the schedule will normally be based on the Australian National All Groups Consumer Price Index weighted average of eight capital cities combined. We use the last published Index for the 12 months ending 30 September each year. Any increase will be applied on the next renewal date on or after 1 January the following year. However, we may use the Index published for a more recent 12 month period and/or another index or rate which we believe more fairly and accurately reflects changes in the cost of living.  

# Total disability benefit  

![](images/ca3e6a62ccadcd3ccf9df357adf5500e25f44d41d9d7da35a774ad9314ad1751.jpg)  

If the insured person is totally disabled (defined below), we’ll pay the Total disability benefit.  

The Total disability benefit amount is calculated and paid monthly. If a Total disability benefit amount is paid, we’ll pay half in arrears and half in advance. If a benefit is paid under the Business Expenses Insurance, we'll pay the Total disability benefit amount at the end of each month in arrears.  

What it means to be totally disabled depends on which plan you hold. Except in relation to the Income Insurance Senior Plan and the Business Expenses Insurance Plan, the definition of totally disabled also depends on the occupation category (see page 68).  

The insured person must meet the requirements for making a claim as set out in How to claim on page 34.

# If the insured person has been totally disabled but is capable of returning to work in a partial capacity  

Only applies to the Income Insurance Plus Plan, Income Insurance Plan, Income Insurance Superannuation Plan, Income Insurance SMSF Plan  

Depending on the insured person's occupation category, a reduced benefit may be payable where the insured person does not return to work. The amount we pay will be worked out applying the formula as set out in the How much we pay for partial disability section above.  

# Occupation categories MP, AA and A  

If the insured person has been totally disabled for at least 7 out of a consecutive 12 days, and does not return to work but medical evidence demonstrates a capacity to work, we may pay a Partial disability benefit based on the insured person 's capacity to return to work.  

# Occupation categories B, C, D, BY, CY, DY and F  

If the insured person has been totally disabled for at least 14 days, and does not return to work but medical evidence demonstrates a capacity to work, we may pay a Partial disability benefit based on the insured person's capacity to return to work.  

# When your benefit is reduced  

An offset amount is the amount which we may reduce your benefit due to any sum of money that you or the insured person receive from any other source. The offset amount depends on the plan that applies and your occupation category (see page 68). However, we won't pay more than the Total disability benefit amount in all situations.  

If we're paying a benefit under the plan , your benefit may be reduced to nil because of the offset amounts . In this case, we’ll be deemed to be paying you a benefit, even though no money is paid by us.

# We may reduce the benefit by the insured person's earnings  

If the insured person earns money from the business , or if the insured person is a co-owner and the insured person 's share of the business earns money, during a period for which we are paying a benefit, the amount he or she earns in any month may be deducted from the benefit we pay. If we deduct earnings , we’ll first reduce them by any costs. That is, any amount paid by the business in any way to the replacement, or to any other employee at the business who generated those earnings .  

# When will we deduct earnings  

In deciding whether we’ll deduct earnings , we’ll calculate the difference between the actual monthly business expenses incurred and the monthly Total disability benefit amount for which you’re insured.

If, after the payment period ends, the insured person is totally disabled or partially disabled because of the same specific injury or sickness, we’ll pay the Total disability benefit (page 73) or Partial disability benefit (page 75), from the later of:  

– the end of the payment period for the specific injury or sickness, or   
– the end of the waiting period.  

The payment period for the specific injuries and sicknesses will count towards the waiting period and, where the benefit period is 2 or 5 years, the payment period will also count towards your benefit period .  

We’ll stop paying if the insured person stops being entitled to benefits for being totally disabled or partially disabled.  

If both an income insurance plan and a PremierLink IP option or StandardLink IP option have been purchased, this benefit will be paid under the PremierLink IP option or StandardLink IP option held outside super.

Premium freeze  

# This option is only available for stepped premiums.  

Exercising this option allows you to maintain your current premium at the time this option is exercised. Your monthly benefit will reduce each year that this option is applied.  

If you choose to cancel Premium freeze, your monthly benefit current at that time will not reduce anymore and Automatic inflation (page 72) will recommence without further health evidence. Premiums will then increase each year according to your age.  

You can request to exercise Premium freeze or cancel it at any time, which will take effect from the next renewal date of the plan.

# Upgrade of benefits  

If we make future improvements to your plan, and such improvements would not result in an increase in premium rates, we will pass these changes on to you without you having to provide us with any medical evidence or evidence regarding the insured person's occupation, pastimes or place of residence.  

Upgrades provide improvements to your plan including additional benefits and improved definitions. You will still retain your existing terms, conditions and premium rates for this plan. Any improvements and/or changes to your plan definitions will always be reviewed at claim time to ensure you're assessed using the definition that benefits you most. This means that should a definition or benefit from your original plan be more beneficial to you, you will still be eligible to claim under your original plan definitions.  

If the insured person is suffering a pre-existing condition at the time the improvement is provided, the improvement will not apply when assessing any claim affected by that pre-existing condition .  

If the insured person is on claim at the time of the upgrade, it will not apply until six months after the claim has ended.  

# Occupation category

# How much we pay  

The amount that we pay will be the percentage (as set out in the table above) of the lump sum amount shown in the insurance schedule .  

If the insured person has more than one of the injuries at the same time, we'll only pay for the one with the highest percentage.  

If we pay an amount under this option, then the lump sum amount is reduced by that amount paid, and we won't pay more than 100% of the lump sum option amount in total for all claims.  

# We’ll increase the lump sum amount by Automatic inflation  

Each year on the renewal date , we'll increase the lump sum amount in accordance with Automatic inflation (page 72).

# Cover boost option

You can increase the monthly benefit by up to 20%, without having to give us medical evidence or evidence about the insured person's occupations, pursuits, pastimes or place of residence.  

Any revised terms applicable to the plan will also apply to increases exercised under this benefit.  

# When you can make an increase  

We'll offer to increase the monthly benefit every third renewal date after this option commenced, up to the insured person's 55th birthday. We call these dates the increase dates. If you increase the monthly benefit , this will increase your premium. If you want to accept this increase you must tell us in writing within 30 days of the eligible renewal date .  

You can bring forward an increase date up to four times by letting us know in writing. This means that you can make up to four increases to the monthly benefit of up to 20% each at an earlier time than every third renewal date .  

If you bring forward an increase date, any remaining increase dates will fall on every third anniversary of the renewal date which falls after the date the increase took effect. You cannot bring forward an increase date if you're on claim under the plan , including during the waiting period .  

# When the increase applies  

The increase will take effect from the increase date. However, the increased benefit will not apply where:  

– an injury or sickness happened before the increase date, or   
– the insured person is on claim at the time of the increase, or   
– the maximum number of increase dates has been reached, or   
– aftertheincrease,the Totaldisabilitybenefitamount would be more than 75% of your pre-disability income at that date, or   
– aftertheincrease,the Totaldisabilitybenefitamount would be more than our limit for new plans at that date.  

There is a maximum number of increase dates We'll offer to increase the monthly benefit a maximum number of times. The maximum number is calculated by using the following formula:  

A = age of the insured person when this option began. Fractionsaredisregardedwhencalculatingthemaximum number of increase dates according to the formula.  

# Increasing claim option  

# This option is not available to occupation categories BY, CY or DY

If we’re paying a benefit because the insured person is partially disabled, we’ll increase the monthly benefit and pre-disability income in accordance with Automatic inflation (page 72) to calculate the Partial disability benefit amount .  

Any increases to the monthly benefit or the pre-disability income will occur on each renewal date while we're paying you a claim.  

We won’t increase the monthly benefit or pre-disability income after the insured person's 65th birthday.  

# ForIncomeInsuranceSuperannuationPlansandIncome Insurance SMSF Plans  

It is a requirement under superannuation law that you cannot receive more than 100% of the insured person's pre-disability income (excluding any indexation). Your benefit under this option will only increase in accordance with Automatic inflation (page 72) on each renewal date up to 100% of the insured person's pre-disability income (excluding any indexation) at the time he or she becomes totally or partially disabled.

# PremierLink IP and StandardLink IP option  

The PremierLink IP option and StandardLink IP option allows you to link benefits that are not available on plans issued through super , to your income insurance plan inside super . These benefits are held on a separate plan outside of super.  

In the event of a claim, the insured person will be assessed under the Total disability benefit (page 73) or Partial disability benefit (page 75) on your income insurance plan inside super . If that definition is met the benefit will be paid directly to the Trustee . At the same time, the insured person will also be assessed under the Total disability benefit or Partial disability benefit on your PremierLink/StandardLink IP option outside of super . If that definition is met a benefit will be paid on your PremierLink/StandardLink IP option.  

The amount paid outside of super is a top-up amount that will bring the total amount paid inside and outside super equal to the Total disability benefit amount or Partial disability benefit amount on the PremierLink/StandardLinkIPoption.Thistop-upamount can be zero if the full value of the Total disability benefit amount or Partial disability benefit amount on the PremierLink/StandardLink IP option is already paid out on the income insurance plan inside superannuation. Any top-up amount will be paid directly to you.  

# General  

– The PremierLink/StandardLink IP option is held on a separate insuranceschedule tothe incomeinsurance plan inside super to which it is linked. – If you’re paid an Elective or cosmetic surgery benefit (page 85), a Return to work bonus (page 87), a Rehabilitation expenses benefit (page 86) or a Specific injuries and sickness benefit (page 88), these benefits will be paid to you directly under the PremierLink IP/StandardLink option outside of super .– When both an income insurance plan inside super and PremierLink/StandardLink IP option are purchased, they have the same structure. For example, they will have the same monthly benefit ,waiting period and benefit period . The PremierLink/StandardLink IP option has the same premium structure and the same renewal date as the income insurance plan inside super. – The income insurance plan inside super will be always operate on an indemnity basis. The PremierLink IP option can operate on an agreed value or indemnity basis. The StandardLink IP option can only operate on an agreed value basis. – If an alteration, increase or reduction is made to the income insurance plan inside super, the alteration, increase or reduction will automatically be applied to the PremierLink/StandardLink IP option. – Ifyoucancelyour incomeinsuranceplan insidesuper, the PremierLink/StandardLink IP option will automatically be cancelled. However, if you cancel the PremierLink/StandardLink IP option, the income insurance plan can remain.  

# When other options are purchased  

– If the Accelerated accident option (page 91), Cover boostoption(page92),Increasingclaimoption(page 93) and/or Superannuation contributions option (page 94) are purchased, they will be applied to both your income insurance plan inside superannuation and the PremierLink/StandardLink IP option. If they are cancelled, they will be cancelled from both.

applied to the PremierLink IP option. If you cancel your PremierLink IP option, this option will automatically be cancelled.  

For further information on the PremierLink IP option and StandardLink IP option, refer to How PremierLink IP and StandardLink IP work section on page 21.  

Refer to the Eligibility criteria for options table on page 28 for entry requirements, expiry age and maximum limits on this option.  

# Superannuation contributions option  

Up to 100% of the insured person's superannuation contribution can be insured in addition to the monthly benefit .  

We allow you to select a superannuation contribution rate ranging from the legislated Superannuation Guarantee Rate to 15%. Please refer to Superannuation Guarantee Rate (page 129) for further information.  

The superannuation contribution rate that you choose will remain the same for the life of the plan and will not increase together with the Superannuation Guarantee Rate legislated increases.  

In the event of a claim we'll pay an amount based on the Superannuation contributions monthly benefit on the insurance schedule to the insured person 's nominated complying superannuation fund for the duration of the claim.  

The amount payable is calculated in the same way as the benefits payable on your income insurance plan or PremierLink/StandardLink IP option.  

For example, if the monthly benefit on your income insurance plan, PremierLink IP option or StandardLink IP optionandSuperannuationcontributionsoptionis\$6,250 and \$750 respectively, and we pay you a Partial disability benefit on the income insurance plan of \$3,000 (48% of \$6,250) per month, we will pay a Partial disability benefit ontheSuperannuationcontributionsoptionof\$360(48% of \$750) per month to your nominated complying superannuation fund.  

IfyoupurchasetheSuperannuationcontributionsoption, your superannuation contributions cannot be included as income when determining the monthly benefit .Any contributions exceeding the selected superannuation contributions rate can be included as income for the purpose of calculating the monthly benefit .  

The Superannuation contributions option applies if we are paying under one of the following:  

– Total disability benefit (page 73)   
– Partial disability benefit (page 75)   
– Specific injuries and sickness benefit (page 88)   
– Nursing care benefit (page 86)   
– Accelerated accident option (page 91)  

In the event of a claim, the insured person will need to provide details of their complying superannuation fund to enable payment of the benefit. The superannuation provider must be either a regulated superannuation fund or retirement savings account as defined in the relevant superannuation and taxation laws. If we are not provided with these details, we may not be able to pay the Superannuation contribution benefit.  

#  

For Income Insurance SMSF Plans, the amount we pay to your superannuation fund needs to be included in your income tax return in the financial year it is received. The income tax payable on the amount paid will need to be paid from another source as the amount paid to the complying superannuation fund or retirement savings account cannot be used to pay income tax because it is required to be preserved in accordance with legislation.  

For Income Insurance Superannuation Plans, the amount we pay to your superannuation fund needs to be included in your income tax return in the financial year it is received. The amount will be paid net of tax. Please refer to the Income Insurance Superannuation Plan taxation information on page 103 for more information.  

# Cancellable plans

We’ll do this provided we receive your written request for a new plan within three months from the date the insured person stopped farming . We'll forward you a new insurance schedule and will notify you when cover begins.

We’ll pay a benefit for claimable events that are applicable for the income insurance plan .  

We only pay a benefit under income insurance if the claimable event happens after the plan starts and before it ends, and subject to the waiting period .  

We won’t pay a benefit under income insurance in some circumstances as set out in When we won’t pay (page 97). Also, for some plans, we may reduce the amount we pay under a benefit if you or the insured person receive payments from other sources (see When your benefit is reduced on pages 80 to 83). The insured person must satisfy our claim requirements before we pay a benefit (page 34).  

If the insured person suffers more than one injury or sickness, or both, at the same time, we'll only pay a benefit for either one injury or one sickness (the condition). We'll do this regardless of whether the sicknesses or injuries are related. We'll determine the condition for which we pay the benefit, based on medical and other evidence.  

The Total disability benefit amount is calculated and paid monthly. We’ll pay half of the benefit in arrears and half of the benefit in advance. For the Business Expenses Insurance Plan, the Total disability benefit amount will be proportioned out and paid at the end of each month in arrears. If you’re eligible to be paid for part of a month, we’ll pay 1/30th of the Total disability benefit amount for each day you’re entitled to be paid.  

For the Partial disability benefit, we’ll pay a proportion of the Total disability benefit amount at the end of each month for which you’re entitled to be paid.  

# When we start paying

However, the benefit period continues throughout the period in which the payments were stopped.  

We’ll only make payments for the period in which they were stopped if you can demonstrate that the insured person has continued to meet the terms and conditions of the plan during the period when payments were stopped.

# Restoring a plan  

If the plan ends because the premium is not paid when it becomes due, you have six months after the date your premiums are paid, in which to ask us to restore it. When we are deciding whether or not to restore the plan, we may ask you for more information and/or require you to undergo medical assessment. The restored plan is a new contract of insurance. You must comply with Your duty of disclosure on page 14.  

If we restore the plan, you’ll have to pay the premium and any premium owing. The plan is restored when we tell you that in writing.  

# We can set conditions  

We can restore the plan on certain conditions and we may decide not to restore the plan at our own discretion. If we restore the plan on a condition that is inconsistent with any condition that was in place before the plan was terminated, that new condition takes priority.  

# What we’ll cover  

If we restore the plan, the restored plan and any new or changed terms and conditions only apply in relation to the diagnosis of, or the suffering from, a claimable event which occurs after it is restored.  

Injuries and sicknesses covered for income insurance plans

# Holding your plan in super  

# Plan membership  

# The plan  

The Life Insurance Superannuation Plan, TPD Insurance Superannuation Plan and Income Insurance SuperannuationPlanareissuedby NMSuper .Theseplans provide insurance for members within Super Directions and Wealth Super (the Fund(s)).  

# Ownership of the plan  

The Life Insurance Superannuation Plan, TPD Insurance Superannuation Plan and Income Insurance Superannuation Plan are held by NM Super as Trustee of Super Directions and Wealth Super .  

Upon acceptance of your application, NM Super will purchase a Life Insurance Superannuation Plan/TPD Insurance Superannuation Plan/Income Insurance Superannuation Plan from AMP Life to provide the benefits you have requested, subject to acceptance of the application for insurance by the Insurer. The Trustee owns the Life Insurance Superannuation Plan/ TPD Insurance Superannuation Plan/Income Insurance Superannuation Plan and holds it on your behalf, as a member of the Fund. The Trustee is a licensed trustee undertheSuperannuationIndustry(Supervision)Act1993 (SIS) and has an appropriate level of indemnity insurance.  

If you purchase a life insurance plan, TPD insurance plan or income insurance plan to be owned by the Trustee of an SMSF or small APRA Super Fund, the Trustee is responsible for meeting the requirements under superannuationlaw,includingensuringthatthemember satisfies the appropriate condition of release before releasing any insurance benefits.  

# Membership of the Fund  

To be an insured person under the plan you must be a member of the Fund. The Funds are registered as superannuation entities under SIS. Your membership will be governed by the terms and conditions of the Trust Deeds of the Funds (as amended from time to time) and superannuation law.  

The premium you pay for the Life Insurance Superannuation Plan, TPD Insurance Superannuation Plan and the Income Insurance Superannuation Plan, the stamp duty and the plan fee are the only cost to you; you pay no other fee or charge for having insurance in the Fund.  

Thebenefitstowhichyouareentitledarelimitedtothose specified under the Life Insurance Superannuation Plan/TPD Insurance Superannuation Plan/Income Insurance Superannuation Plan.  

Insurance cover will cease when:  

– You are no longer a member of the Fund, or – There are insufficient funds in your superannuation account to pay your premiums, or – You cease to be eligible to contribute to superannuation over age 65 due to superannuation age restrictions and there are insufficient funds in your superannuation account to pay your premiums.  

Payment of any benefit to you by the Trustee is subject to acceptance of a claim by AMP. Payment of premiums beyond age 65 is subject to you remaining eligible to contribute to superannuation.  

# Taxation information  

The tax information contained in this PDS is based on the Trustee’s understanding of the current law and of current Australian Taxation Office (ATO) practice at the date of publication. Our comments are a general guide only. The tax treatment may vary according to your individual circumstances.  

You should seek professional advice concerning your own taxation position. Further taxation information can be found at ato.gov.au.  

# Contributions tax  

All employer contributions paid to the Fund (including voluntary salary sacrifice contributions) and any contributions for which you claim a tax deduction are called concessional contributions and are currently taxed in the Fund at a maximum rate of 15%. The Fund will charge this tax when the contributions are received by the Fund or on receipt of a valid notice of your intention to claim a tax deduction.  

This15%contributionstaxmaybereducedbydeductions (available to the Fund) for items such as insurance premiums. So, where a contribution is wholly applied to pay for insurance premiums, as is the case where AMP Elevate is provided via Super Directions , the contributions tax charge rate is set as zero.  

Partial rollovers into AMP Elevate via Super Directions are not subject to tax in Super Directions . As no tax deduction is available to you, a tax benefit of 15% of the premium is allocated in advance to be applied to pay the premium.  

Individuals with income and certain contributions for an income year over the high income earners cap will be liable for an additional tax of 15% on the lesser of the excess over that cap and the contributions. This is in addition to contributions tax and is taxed by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) direct to the member. This may be paid from your super account balance, but not from a defined benefit interest.  

# Concessional contributions cap  

An annual contribution limit (also known as a contributions cap) applies on the amount of concessional contributions each person can make per year.  

Contributions in excess of the annual cap (referred to as excess concessional contributions) are included in the individual’s taxable income and taxed at their marginal rate (plus Medicare levy less a 15% tax offset) plus an interest charge levied by the ATO. This is in addition to the contributions tax (15%). The tax on excess concessional contributions is imposed on the individual.  

The annual concessional contribution cap is indexed. When assessing your eligibility to make concessional contributions you should check that current cap at www.ato.gov.au.  

Furthermore, excess concessional contributions are counted towards the non-concessional contributions cap (see below).  

# Non-concessional contributions cap  

Non-concessional contributions include:  

– personal contributions for which you do not claim a tax deduction, and   
– spouse contributions.  

An annual contribution limit (also known as a contributions cap) applies on the amount of non-concessional contributions each person can make per year. The annual non-concessional contribution cap is indexed. When assessing your eligibility to make non-concessional contributions you should check the current cap rules at www.ato.gov.au . If you are under age 65 at any time during the financial year, you may be eligible to bring forward two years of non-concessional contributions into one year. Members aged 65 or over on 1 July can only make non-concessional contributions of up to the current annual non-concessional contribution cap in that year and each subsequent year to age 75, subject to being gainfully employed on at least a part-timebasis.Nofurthernon-concessionalcontribution cap is available for the financial year if your total superannuation balance is \$1.6 million or more. For more information, refer to the Eligibility to make contributions section on page 105 of this PDS .  

Non-concessional contributions in excess of this cap will be taxed at 45% plus the Medicare levy, plus 2% Temporary Budget levy for the 2016–17 income year. The recently introduced ability to have the excess non-concessionalcontributionsrefundedandthe interest taxed at marginal rates is not available in AMP Elevate in Super Directions , because all contributions are fully applied to premiums, leaving no balance to enable a refund.  

The Trustee is prevented by law from accepting a non-concessional contribution that is greater than the eligible bring forward amount in one transaction for individuals who are under age 65 or the eligible annual non-concessional contribution cap amount in one transaction for individuals age 65 or over on 1 July of the relevant financial year. The Trustee is required by law to refund the excess contribution and is entitled to deduct an administration fee and any transaction costs and premiums that have been paid in relation to cover for a specific period.  

If you are a member of Super Directions , any insurance premiums you pay are considered to be superannuation contributions and will count towards your contributions cap.  

Your Super Directions membership does not have an investment component. This means it cannot accept spouse contributions, co-contributions from the ATO, rollovers from other superannuation funds, except as part of the partial rollover facility.  

Wealth Super can accept payment from these sources where you are a member of the Fund and hold insurance throughMyNorth,North,Summit,GenerationsoriAccess.  

There are some exceptions to the contribution rules. For more information, please contact your financial adviser .  

# Deductions and offsets  

Depending on your circumstances, tax deductions or offsetsforcontributionsusedtofundthepremiumsmay be available. Tax deductions (subject to certain restrictions) may be available for premiums paid by employers, employees who receive no employer support and the self-employed or substantially self-employed. For more information, please contact your financial adviser /tax adviser.  

# Life Insurance Superannuation Plan  

Deathbenefitlumpsumspaidtodependants,asdefined for tax purposes (eg spouse, de facto spouse, your child underage18,orpeoplefinanciallydependentonaperson at the time of death or in an interdependent relationship) are generally tax free.  

Where Death benefit lump sums are paid to a person who is not a tax dependant they are generally taxed at a rate of up to 15% (30% in certain circumstances) plus the Medicare levy.  

For TPD insurance, the insurance benefit will be part of the taxable component, but can be reduced by a tax free component calculated under tax law. Tax treatment will depend on whether you take the benefit as a lump sum or rollover to purchase an income stream.Please speak to your accountant for further information.  

# Income Insurance Superannuation Plan  

Benefits (including Superannuation contributions option benefits) under the plan will need to be included in your assessable income and will be paid to you net of tax.  

At the end of each financial year we will issue you with a PAYG summary showing your benefits paid and tax deducted. This will need to be included in your tax return. Please speak to your accountant for further information.  

# Providing a tax file number (TFN)  

Your tax file number is confidential. Before you provide your tax file number we are required to tell you the following:  

Under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, your superannuation fund is authorised to collect your TFN, which will only be used for lawful purposes.  

These purposes may change in the future as a result of legislative change. The Trustee may disclose your TFN to another superannuation provider, unless you request the Trustee in writing that your TFN not be disclosed to any other superannuation provider.  

It is not an offence not to quote your TFN. However, giving your TFN to the Trustee will have the following advantages:  

– Your superannuation fund will be able to accept all types of contributions to your account(s). – The tax on contributions to your superannuation account(s) will not increase. – Other than the tax that may ordinarily apply, no additional tax will be deducted when you start drawing down your superannuation benefits. – It will be easier to trace different superannuation accounts in your name so that you receive all your superannuation benefits when you retire.  

If you do not provide your tax file number, the Trustee will not be able to accept any payment for premiums and your application for insurance will not be accepted.  

# Eligibility to make contributions  

Anyone under the age of 65 can contribute to superannuation at any time on their own behalf or for someone else who is under 65.  

# If aged between 65 and 74  

Between the ages of 65 and 74, eligibility to contribute is subject to satisfying the work test. To satisfy this test a member must have worked at least 40 hours in a period of not more than 30 consecutive days in the financial year in which the contribution is made.  

# Employer/member supported plans  

Life insurance and income insurance superannuation plans can be:  

– Employer supported—the employer pays the premium on behalf of the employee, and – Member supported—the member pays the premiums.  

# Cancelling your plan  

If you are a member of Super Directions and you cancel your insurance, you will automatically cancel your membership of the Fund.  

If you are a member of Wealth Super and you cancel your insurance, you will remain a member of the Fund with no insurance cover.  

You must be a member of either Fund to hold insurance under superannuation.  

If you cancel your insurance, any premiums paid must be subject to preservation rules, governed by superannuation rules applicable at the time.  

# Nominating beneficiaries

# Nomination of dependant  

If applying for a Life Insurance Superannuation Plan held through Super Directions, you should complete the non-binding or binding nomination form in the Application form attached to this PDS.  

If applying for a Life Insurance Superannuation Plan via membership through MyNorth, North, Summit, Generations or iAccess, your nomination of dependants for distribution of your death benefits (which includes youraccumulationamountandyourinsuranceproceeds) requires the completion of the appropriate death benefit nomination form available under MyNorth, North, Summit, Generations or iAccess. You cannot make a separate binding nomination for your insurance benefits only.  

Completion of the superannuation nomination of dependants form accompanying AMP Elevate insurance Application form will be void if your policy is under the MyNorth, North, Summit, Generations or iAccess Superannuation or Pension Plan.  

The recipient of death benefits from a superannuation fund in the event of the death of a member is generally determined by the Trustee , at its discretion. However, the Trustee offers binding nominations for people who hold the Life Insurance Superannuation Plan offered through Super Directions and Wealth Super .  

Binding nominations give you greater control over who receives your life insurance benefit under your Life Insurance Superannuation Plan.  

Alternatively, you may still make a non-binding nomination; however, this nomination gives the Trustee of the Fund discretion on how to pay your benefit.  

# Types of nominations  

There are three types of nominations:  

– Binding – Non-binding, and – No-nominations.  

# Binding nominations  

A binding nomination means the trustee ( NM Super ) is obliged to pay your benefit to the people you nominate in the proportions you specify.  

It’s important you:  

– only nominate those who are eligible, such as your dependants and/or your estate or a legal representative (see below)   
– ensure the allocations add up to 100% (use whole numbers)   
– update your binding nomination every three years, and   
– update your binding nomination if there is a change in your personal circumstances, such as marriage, divorce or entering a defacto relationship and/or the death of one of your beneficiaries.  

A binding death benefit nomination gives you certainty about who will receive your superannuation benefit in the event of your death. When you have nominated a beneficiary and the nomination is valid under superannuation law, the trustee will act in accordance withthatnomination.However,theFederalGovernment has imposed strict conditions on how a beneficiary must be nominated.  

A beneficiary must be a:  

– spouse (including de facto spouse or same sex partner),   
– a child (including an adopted child, step child or ex-nuptial child),   
– the child of the insured’s spouse or any person who is, or was at the relevant time, in the opinion of the Trustee, in an interdependency relationship with the insured (generally a close personal relationship between two people who live together, where one or both provides the other with financial support, domestic support and personal care),   
– a legal personal representative or any person who, in the opinion of the Trustee, is, or was at the relevant time, dependent in whole or part upon the insured.  

Ifanybeneficiarynominatedisnotadependantaccording to superannuation law at the date of your death, this notice will be invalid.  

With binding nominations, you may nominate specific individuals and the portion of the death benefit they will receive under the plan. You will only be able to nominate individuals who are eligible under superannuation law.  

# How to make a binding nomination

If a bindingnomination was not completed when applying for membership of Wealth Super, and you would like a binding nomination to apply to your MyNorth, North, Summit, Generations oriAccess superannuation benefits and yourinsurance,a nomination form may be obtained from your financial adviser.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# How a binding nomination works  

To make a binding nomination you will need to provide the personal details of your dependants to whom your death benefit is to be paid. You will need to provide their full name, address details, date of birth, sex, and their relationship to you.  

If you choose to make a binding nomination, the Trustee will pay your benefit to the person(s) you have nominated as long as your nomination:  

– Is valid   
– Has been made in the prescribed manner   
– Is received by the Trustee before your death   
– Has not expired, and the nominated person(s) is a dependant (as defined in the governing rules of the Fund and by superannuation law) or your legal personal representative.  

To be valid, a nomination must:  

– Nominate one or more dependants and/or your legal personal representative and provide the percentage of the death benefit for each nominee to receive in the event of your death. The proportional entitlements must total 100%,   
– Be fully completed by you and signed in the presence of your witnesses,   
– Be witnessed by two people who are aged 18 years or over and neither of whom is nominated on the form. Each witness must also sign and date the Witness Declaration section, and   
– Date the form as at the date of completion.  

However, the Trustee is not required to pay the Death benefit in accordance with the binding nomination if:  

– The Trustee is subject to a court order and doing so would breach the court order, or   
– The Trustee is aware that the giving of, or failure to amend or revoke a nomination was a breach of a court order.  

Your nomination expires after three years. You may want to review your nomination regularly and update your nomination as your personal circumstances change, eg divorce, birth of children, death of a partner or nominee. It is your responsibility to keep your nomination up to date and review it every three years. You may update your binding nomination by completing a new binding Death benefit beneficiary nomination form at any time.  

The binding nomination will normally become invalid when one of the following happens:  

– Three years have lapsed from the date the Binding nomination form was signed and you have not reconfirmed the nomination prior to the expiry date.   
– Any nominated beneficiary dies before you die.   
– Any nominated beneficiary (other than the legal personal representative) is not a dependant at the time of death.   
– If your spouse is nominated and you get divorced or your de facto relationship ends after signing the Binding nomination form.  

If the binding nomination is no longer valid, then the Trustee will automatically treat the binding nomination as a non-binding nomination.  

If you wish to revoke a binding death benefit nomination, you must complete, sign and date the revocation in the presence of two witnesses who are aged 18 years or over and neither of whom were nominated on the form. Each witness must also sign and date the witness declaration section.  

If you nominate your legal personal representative as your beneficiary, please make sure that you have a valid and up-to-date will. If you die without a will, the Trustee may have to pay the benefit to a court-appointed administrator who will pay the benefit in accordance with a statutory formula that varies from state to state.  

Payment to a legal personal representative may also take longer to effect as it is necessary for a Grant of Probate or Letters of Administration to be issued before the benefit can be paid.  

You should note that by directing payment to your legal personal representative you may be exposing the benefit to claims by creditors of your estate.  

Your financial adviser can assist you in assessing your estate planning.  

In the event that your nomination is not valid or has expired, your death benefit will be paid at the discretion of the Trustee to one or more of your dependants and/or legal personal representative.  

# Non-bindingnominationornonominationmade  

A non-binding nomination means the trustee will pay your benefit to your dependant(s) or legal representative in proportions the trustee determines. Non-binding nominations don’t need to be updated every three years, but they still need to be valid and reflect any changes in your personal circumstances.  

If you haven’t nominated a beneficiary the trustee will pay your benefit to your estate. It is important to have a will and make sure it covers your superannuation benefit. If your estate is insolvent or a legal representative isn’t appointed to manage your estate within a reasonable amount of time, the trustee will decide which of your beneficiaries, or others, will receive your benefit and in what proportions.  

However, regardless of whether you make a non-binding nomination or no nomination, the Trustee has the discretion to pay your benefit to one or more of your dependants and/or your legal personal representative in any proportions it determines.  

To make a non-binding death benefit nomination, Super Directions members should complete the Nomination of dependants section of the Application form. For MyNorth,North,Summit,GenerationsandiAccess,please complete the death benefit nomination form available under North, Summit, Generations or iAccess.  

You should be aware that any directions that you may have included in your last will for the payment of your life insurance benefit under the Fund cannot legally bind the Trustee. However, the Trustee will take your expressed wishes into account. Therefore you may want to update your will and your non-binding nomination whenever your circumstances change.  

You may provide the Trustee with a written indication of your preference for the disbursement of the benefit from the Fund in the event of death.  

It is essential that you keep the Trustee fully informed of your current preferences for the payment of your benefits in the event of your death.  

# Who qualifies as my dependant?  

The Trustee must ensure that the benefits are paid to your legal personal representative or dependants as defined in the Trust Deed and applicable law. A dependant is defined as:  

# – The spouse  

– Each child (including an adopted child, step-child or an ex-nuptial child) of a member, or the child of a member’s spouse   
– Any person who is, or was at the relevant time, in the opinion of the Trustee, in an interdependency relationship with the member (generally a close personal relationship between two people who live together, where one or both provides the other with financial support, domestic support and personal care)   
– Any person who in the opinion of the Trustee is, or was at the relevant time, dependent in whole or in part upon the member, or   
– Any other person treated for the purposes of superannuation law as a dependant.  

The beneficiary of your death benefit can ask to receive the payment as a lump sum.  

# Who is a spouse?  

A spouse is a person who is legally married to the member, or a person who, although not legally married to the member, lives (or lived at the time of the member’s death) with the member on a genuine domestic basis in a relationship as a couple and includes a same-sex partner.  

Where a Life Insurance Superannuation Plan is held through membership of Wealth Super , any insurance benefit payable under the Life Insurance Superannuation Plan will be credited to your super account. In the event of your death, any insurance benefit will form part of the death benefit available within the Fund, and will be distributed by the Trustee in accordance with any death benefit nomination you have provided in respect of your account and/or the Trustee’s discretion if there is no valid binding death benefit nomination. You cannot make a separatedeathbenefitnominationinrespectofyourLife Insurance Superannuation Plan.  

# General terms and conditions  

The plan is issued subject to the Life Insurance Act 1995, the Insurance Contracts Act 1984, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997,theSuperannuationIndustry(Supervision)Act1993 and any other Act of Parliament regulating the terms of insurance contracts and the operationofsuperannuation funds.

If you are in business and take out this cover for revenue purposes (for example, replacing business income if a key person dies), the premiums will generally be tax deductible and any benefits received will generally be assessed as income.  

If you are in business and take out this cover for a capital purpose (for example, repaying a debt if a key person dies), then the premium is not tax deductible and the proceeds will not be subject to income tax. However, CGT may apply depending on who receives the proceeds.  

In the case of TPD and trauma proceeds, as long as the life insured or a defined relative of the life insured receives the insurance proceeds, there will not be any CGT implications. For more information please consult your accountant.  

CGT will not apply to life insurance proceeds received upon your death unless the recipient of the proceeds is not the original beneficial owner and that person acquired the right to the plan for money or other consideration.  

# Income insurance and Business expenses plans  

Generally, your premium is tax deductible and any amounts (including PremierLink IP, StandardLink IP and Superannuation contributions option) we pay to or for you are assessable income.  

However, premiums paid for the accident lump sum option or the occupationally acquired HIV, Hepatitis B andHepatitisCoptionarenottaxdeductibleandbenefits received are not assessable for income tax.  

Please consult your accountant regarding your personal situation. They will be able to provide you with more detailed information.  

# Goods and services tax (GST)  

You do not have to pay GST on your premiums or any benefits you receive.  

# Paying your premiums  

# Statutory Fund  

We pay your premiums into, and all benefit payments are paid out of (and are limited to), a statutory fund called our Statutory Fund No. 1. The statutory fund is regulated under the Life Insurance Act 1995.  

# Payment of premiums  

You must pay your premiums, including any charges, when they are due and in Australian dollars for the plan to remain current. The premium includes the cost of providing the insurance and all taxes, duties, charges and the plan fee.  

If your premium is not paid when it becomes due, we may cancel your plan. However, we will give you 28 days written notice before we cancel it for this reason.  

Frequency : You can pay fortnightly, monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or yearly. If you are paying your super premiums by partial rollovers (see page 111) you must select yearly frequency.  

# Ways you can pay  

If you pay quarterly, half-yearly or yearly you can ask to receive a payment due notice. Or you have the option of paying via direct debit from your bank account or credit card.  

If you choose to pay fortnightly or monthly, you’ll need to pay by direct debit. A direct debit form is enclosed in the AMP Elevate Application form at the back of this document.  

![](images/3218822b946baf6e6cf187ed5fb5dabeb4c23154672f44e75f3b17b73ff047b9.jpg)  
(i) Please refer to the direct debit service request information for full details of the Direct Debit Request Service Agreement on page 111. (ii) The bank, financial institution or credit card provider may in its absolute discretion charge a fee for this service. In that event, we will pass the fee on to you. (iii) Not available for plans owned by SMSFs  

# For plans owned by Super Directions  

If you are a member of Super Directions and you elect to use the rollover facility, your premiums will be paid from your nominated superannuation fund via annual rollover or transfer.  

# For plans owned under MyNorth, North, Summit, Generations or iAccess  

Your premium, including the applicable plan fee and instalment loading, will be deducted from your cash account.  

# Paying using the rollover facility  

We offer members of Super Directions a facility that enables premiums to be paid using superannuation money. If you wish to have your insurance with us but your nominated superannuation account with another superannuation fund (provided it’s a taxed superannuation fund), you can pay the premiums using money from your nominated superannuation fund. You simplyneedtocompleteandsendusanenduringrollover authority (contained in the Application form). This authority allows us to act on your behalf to request a rollover or transfer from your nominated superannuation account as and when the policy premium is due.  

You won’t need to complete a new authority each year. The authority continues until the earliest of you requesting a revocation, you giving us a new authority, the policy ending or your death.  

If you change your nominated superannuation account, you will need to provide us with a new enduring rollover authority.  

If the amount received from your nominated superannuation account is not equal to the amount requested, it will be returned to the transferring fund. If this happens, or if the rollover or transfer is not successful for any other reason, an alternative payment is required otherwise your policy may lapse. If we can’t return any amounts to the transferring fund, we may transfer the amount to the AMP Eligible Rollover Fund. By purchasing a plan and completing an enduring rollover authority, you authorise us to do so.  

The amount required to pay the premium by rollover or transfer will be reduced by a 15% tax benefit, which means that only 85% of the premium due needs to be rolled over. For example, if your annual premium is \$100, we will only request for a rollover of \$85. If you change the method of payment in the future or a rollover or transfer request is not successful and an alternative payment method is required, you may not receive the credit of the tax benefit. This tax benefit is allocated at the Trustee’s discretion. The Trustee may review or change its practice in the future.  

Importantly,onlyannualpremiumpaymentsareavailable when paying using the rollover facility.  

# How to pay the premium  

Make your premium payments using telephone or internet banking from your credit card, cheque or savings account.  

For information on your biller code and CRN, please refer to your payment due notice. You can also access your payment due notice by logging onto your My AMP account and viewing your statements.

AMP maintains a register of the non-monetary benefits that we pay to financial advisers from time to time, also known as AMP’s gifts and entertainment register. A copy oftheregistermayberequestedbycalling1800780085.
